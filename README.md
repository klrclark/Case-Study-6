The case study included two datasets that could have been downloaded from the following URLs or downloaded directly from the website and saved on your personal computer.  I chose to download the dataset from the URL directly (which were considered the original datasets) and then pull it from the file saved on my computer

Load the Gross Domestic Product data for the 190 ranked countries in this data set:

Load the educational data from this data set: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv 

Original data sources (if the links above donâ€™t work): 
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table 
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats 

Original data files can be found in the Data folder, with the following names:
GDA - GDP ranking table
CountryData -  Country Data - ed-stats data set

Since I chose to download the most current file there were 195 ranked countries in the dataset.
