This folder contains all the datasets used in the Case Study 6

GDA and Country Data are the original datasets that were downloaded from the websites detailed on the README.md file

GDA1

This dataset was created to remove columns 3 and 6 from the dataset.  Only columns 1,2,4, and 5 were left in the GDA1 data set

GDA2

This dataset was created to remove rows where all columns were NA

GDA3

This dataset was created to removed rows where the Economy field = ".."

The GDP data was now cleansed and ready.

Country Data

CData 

This dataset was created to only select columns 1, 2, and 9 from the original CountryData dataset.  This dataset had minimal data cleansing items that needed to be done

Merging CData and GDA3

cleanset

This dataset was created when the two datasets GDA3 and CData were merged on Countrycode.  All records from the GDA3 were added to the dataset and only the records from 
CData where there was a Country Code match was added to the table

cleanset.filtered 

This dataset was created to remove additional rows where there were NAs


cleanset.sorted

This dataset was created to sort the dataset by the Ranking field in order to answer the Case Study question: Sort data frame in descending order
by GDP rank (where USA is last). What is the 13th country in the data frame?  

cleanset.sorted2 

this dataset was only used to ensure the data was sorted correctly
